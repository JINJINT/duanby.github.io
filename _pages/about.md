My name is Boyan Duan, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy](http://stat.cmu.edu). My primary research interests are statistical inference methodologies with data adaptiveness.

I am very fortunate to be advised by professor [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and professor [Larry Wasserman](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/). We are working on developing human-in-the-loop algorithms for hypothesis testing.
